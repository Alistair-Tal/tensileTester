# tensileTester
Collection of files related to 431 Systems Analysis + Design's tensile strength project

The system will preform tensile material strength tests for the UAlbany Chemistry Dept.

The project is based off this paper : 

Fabrication of an Economical Arduino-Based Uniaxial Tensile Tester
Julien H. Arrizabalaga, Aaron D. Simmons, and Matthias U. Nollert
Journal of Chemical Education 2017 94 (4), 530-533

All changes made to the original design are included in the slideshow and Physical Design.

Standalone Matlab App can be used with any .csv file format with CM and Newtons as units listed as so:
6CM , 0N
6.5CM , 0.5N
etc...

Load Slope code adapted from Professor Muckells example.
